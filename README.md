# TicTacMas

**Intelligence System Project by astaga.ai. Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia**

This project is inspired by the classic Tic Tac Toe game. The game is designed with Indonesian folklore Timun Mas as the theme of the game.

A Minimax algorithm is implemented in this project and we also apply Alpha-Beta Pruning. We also create this for 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 board games that you can choose, with 3 different difficulties: easy, medium, and hard. This game is written with Vanilla HTML+CSS+JavaScript
